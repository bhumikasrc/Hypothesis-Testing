## Definition

Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make informed decisions about a population based on sample data. It involves formulating two competing hypotheses, the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (Ha), and then collecting and analyzing data to determine whether there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.


## Statistical Methods

• <u>T Test</u> - The t-test is a statistical hypothesis test used to determine whether:

* the population mean is significantly different from a claim about the mean

* there is a significant difference between the means of two groups or samples

It is particularly useful when working with small sample sizes and is employed to assess whether the observed differences in sample means are likely to represent true differences in the population or if they could have occurred by chance.
